# Asteroids
A spaceship shooter game had to further develop as part of my Games Technology module. I was provided the base game and was tasked with adding extra features to it. The features I added were:

1) Asteroids that split into smaller asteroids when hit, using a different sprite for differentiation. This adds another layer of difficulty to the game.
2) A highscore system that reads and writes from a txt file and displays once the user reaches the "Game Over" screen.
3) An alien spaceship which acted as an 'enemy' that follows the player and attempts to shoot them down.

For the code, I achieved 29.3 marks out of a possible 30. Full documentation (with images) on what exactly I did can be found in the file "Asteroids Documentation.pdf".
